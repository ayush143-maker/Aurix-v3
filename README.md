# Aurix-v3

Aurix-v3 is an Expo and React Native codebase for an Android and iOS music-listening app. The root entry files are `App.tsx` and `index.ts`; application navigation and provider structure are under `src/`. The project includes player and library state, native integrations, and supporting assets in `assets/`, with dependencies including React Navigation, React Native Track Player, local storage, and Expo notifications. The README does not establish a connected music catalogue or streaming service.

## Getting started

Install dependencies and start the Expo development server:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Platform commands are also available:

```sh
npm run android
npm run ios
npm run web
```

Android and iOS runs require the relevant native development tools and a compatible device or simulator. The web command targets the web build; it does not replace reviewing native playback.

## Personalize and review

For visible app content and presentation, inspect the relevant screens and components under `src/` and the supporting files in `assets/` before editing; the root listing does not identify individual screen or asset filenames. Keep existing asset references intact when moving or renaming files, and update every corresponding reference if a move is necessary.

For app-level identity or platform-specific settings, review the existing configuration in `app.json`, `eas.json`, and the platform files before changing them. Do not assume these files are interchangeable or edit service configuration without checking its purpose. After a change, use `npm start` and review it in the relevant development environment; use the Android or iOS command for native-specific changes.
